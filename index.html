      <p>
        Welcome to my website! I'm Yinpu Li.

        I completed my Ph.D in Statistics at the Florida State University, 
        under the direction of Professor Antonio R. Linero and Professor Sinha Deb. 
        I received my MS in Statistics from the George Washington University and my 
        BS in Mathematics Statistics from the East China Normal University.
        
        Presently, I'm serving as a Senior Data Scientist at Chewy, based in Washington. 
        My work primarily revolves around the exciting realms of anomaly detection for 
        SKU (products featured on our website) performance and the application of LLMs 
        and multi-modal models for effective product matching. 
        Before my tenure at Chewy, I had the opportunity to contribute as a Research Scientist 
        at Convoy, where I focused on the development of efficient matching mechanisms.
        
        While my professional journey continues to unfold, my engagement in 
        academia remains steadfast. My research aspirations span the diverse 
        landscape of versatile Bayesian methods and the exploration of a wide array 
        of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.

            I am currently 
            a senior Data Scientist at Chewy and focus on anomaly detection for SKU (products on our
            website) performance and product matching using LLMs and multi-modal models. Before Chewy, 
            I was a Research Scientist at Convoy, and my work has been focused on developing appropriate methods for matching 
            mechanisms.

            Except for industry work, I am still actively working in academia and 
            my research is broadly focused on developing flexible Bayesian methods and ML/AI methods.
