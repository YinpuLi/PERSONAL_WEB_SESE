          My name is Yinpu Li; welcome to my website!
          I am currently a Research Scientist at Convoy, based in Seattle, WA.
          I completed my Ph.D in Statistics at the Florida State University, under
          the direction of Professor Antonio R. Linero and Professor Sinha Deb. 
          I received my MS in Statistics from the George Washington University and my BS
          in Mathematics Statistics from the East China Normal University.

            My research is broadly focused on developing flexible Bayesian methods. 
            My work at Convoy has focused on developing appropriate methods for matching 
            mechanisms.
